    "## **Algorithm Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction algorithm designed to embed high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space while preserving **local neighborhood structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to convert pairwise distances in high-dimensional space into probability distributions, and then find a low-dimensional embedding whose probability distribution is as similar as possible by minimizing KL-divergence. It is importent to note, that in t-SNE we tune the data’s low-dimensional coordinates themselves rather than adjusting model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Compute Pairwise Affinities in High Dimension**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each point $x_i$, define conditional probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{j|i} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|x_i - x_j\\|^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_i$ — the $i$-th data point in the original high-dimensional space.  \n",
    "- $x_j$ — a neighboring data point whose similarity to $x_i$ we measure.  \n",
    "- $\\|x_i - x_j\\|^2$ — squared Euclidean distance between points $x_i$ and $x_j$.  \n",
    "- $\\sigma_i$ — the bandwidth (standard deviation) of the Gaussian centered at $x_i$, selected individually per point.  \n",
    "- $p_{j|i}$ — the conditional probability that $x_i$ would pick $x_j$ as a neighbor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Symmetrize the Probabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each point $x_i$ uses its own $\\sigma_i$, the conditional probabilities $p_{j|i}$ and $p_{i|j}$ reflect two different local neighborhoods (“two different families of relatives”). So even if the distance $\\|x_i - x_j\\|$ is the same in both directions, the probabilities are not. t-SNE cannot work with two different notions of similarity for the same pair. To define **one shared, mutual similarity** between $x_i$ and $x_j$, we combine the two directional probabilities:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{ij} = \\frac{p_{j|i} + p_{i|j}}{2n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Initialize Low-Dimensional Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly initialize $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ (or $\\mathbb{R}^3$) according to the visualization type we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Define Low-Dimensional Similarities Using a t-Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the low-dimensional space, we also want a *imilarity distribution between points: pairs that are close in 2D should get high similarity, and far pairs should get low similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used a **Gaussian** here (like in the high-dimensional space), many points would be pulled too close together in the center, which leads to the **crowding problem**: too many moderately distant points all collapse near the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, t-SNE uses a **heavy-tailed** distribution so that moderately far points still exert noticeable “repulsive” force.  We choose a **Student-t distribution with 1 degree of freedom** (also known as the Cauchy distribution), whose probability density function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(t) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nu + 1}{2}\\right)}\n",
    "{\\sqrt{\\nu\\pi}\\,\\Gamma\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)}\n",
    "\\left(1 + \\frac{t^2}{\\nu}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\nu + 1}{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\nu = 1$ this simplifies to (up to a constant factor):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(t) \\propto \\frac{1}{1 + t^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In t-SNE we plug in the low-dimensional distance\n",
    "$t = \\|y_i - y_j\\|$ and then normalize over all pairs to get a proper probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q_{ij} = \\frac{(1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2)^{-1}}\n",
    "{\\sum_{k \\neq l} (1 + \\|y_k - y_l\\|^2)^{-1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This $q_{ij}$ is the **low-dimensional similarity** between $y_i$ and $y_j$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Minimize KL-Divergence Between $P$ and $Q$**\n",
    "\n",
    "We optimize this expression iteratively with the reugular techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{KL}(P\\|Q)\n",
    "=\n",
    "\\sum_{i \\neq j} p_{ij} \\log \\frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does **not scale well** to very large datasets, naively complexity is $O(n^2)$)\n",
    "- **Global structure is unreliable** — only local neighborhoods are meaningful.\n",
    "- t-SNE optimizes the embedded coordinates themselves, no so we **don't get at the end of the learning a function that can map new data** into the space like in PCA\n",
    "- **Sensitive to hyperparameters** such as perplexity and learning rate.  \n",
    "- **No inverse transform** — cannot reconstruct high-dimensional vectors from the 2D embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Use-Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization of high-dimensional datasets** such as images, text embeddings, biological data, user behavior features, or any complex structured data.\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to reveal clusters, subgroups, anomalies, or hidden structure that may not be visible in the raw high-dimensional space.\n",
    "- **Understanding model representations**, for example examining the latent space of neural networks, autoencoders, or transformer embeddings.\n",
